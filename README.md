Data Science Technical Challenge - SARAO  

(disclaimer: this code repo contains a set of example exercises for a job interview.)

In this technical challenge we want to test for basic skills such as python coding, ability to handle data and reuse open-source code etc., but also to explore more intangible skills such as flexibility, creativity, independence, communication, ability to relearn and teach yourself, ability to implement ideas, ability to solve challenging problems and to scale them to handle large volumes of data.
